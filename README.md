## Description

Introducing a user-friendly deck building application that empowers authorized users to effortlessly create, edit and personalize their own decks, (including the ability to change the color scheme) as well as view single (card by card) or All cards. The application features robust security measures such as phone verification using Firebase, login authentication utilizing Bcrypt and JWT, and a reset password function utilizing Node Mailer to send unique links to users for changing their passwords. Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, the application offers a smooth, seamless experience across platforms. Built using TypeScript, it is deployed on a secure domain hosted by Hostinger and features a custom-built REST API hosted on a VPS. Data is securely stored using a MongoDB Atlas cluster.
